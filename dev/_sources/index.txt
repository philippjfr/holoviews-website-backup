Installation
____________

HoloViews is compatible with Python `2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 <https://travis-ci.org/ioam/holoviews>`_.

HoloViews requires `Param <http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_ and `Numpy
<http://numpy.org>`_, neither of which has any required dependencies,
and so it should be very easy to integrate HoloViews into your
workflow or as part of another project.

For a minimal install, you can obtain HoloViews along with the latest
public releases of its core dependencies (`Param
<http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_ and `Numpy <http://numpy.org>`_)
using pip::

  pip install holoviews


For plotting, HoloViews uses `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_,
as its default backend, which most scientists and engineers
using Python will already have installed.  HoloViews is pure Python,
but it also provides optional extensions enabled with ``%load_ext``
above that make it integrate well with `IPython Notebook
<http://ipython.org/notebook>`_ 2 and 3.

The quickest and easiest way to get the latest version of all the
packages recommended for working with HoloViews in the IPython
Notebook is via `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ (e.g using
`miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_)::

  conda install -c ioam holoviews

Alternatively, you can also use pip::

  pip install 'holoviews[recommended]'

This will install Matplotlib and IPython Notebook if they are not
already available as part of a scientific Python distribution such as
`Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ (particularly convenient
on systems shipped without pip, such as Windows or Mac).

We also support the following install option::

  pip install 'holoviews[extras]'

In addition to the required and recommended packages, this command also
installs the optional `bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/>`_, `mpld3
<http://mpld3.github.io/>`_, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and `Seaborn
<http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html>`_ libraries.

Lastly, to get everything including `cyordereddict
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cyordereddict>`_ to enable optional
speed optimizations and `nose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/>`_
for running unit tests, you can use::

  pip install 'holoviews[all]'

To get the latest development version you can instead clone our git
repositories::

  git clone git://github.com/ioam/param.git
  git clone git://github.com/ioam/holoviews.git

Once you've installed HoloViews, you can get started by launching
IPython Notebook::

  ipython notebook

Now you can download the `tutorial notebooks`_.  unzip them somewhere
IPython Notebook can find them, and then open the Homepage.ipynb
tutorial or any of the others in the Notebook.  Enjoy exploring your
data!

particularly if they come with test cases showing how to reproduce the bugs and 
`pull requests <http://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/>`_
showing how to fix the bug or implement the feature!
